== Usage

=== `WORKSPACE` File

==== Load dependencies, select Ruby SDK and define one or more Bundles

[source,python]
----
workspace(name = "my_ruby_project")

load("@bazel_tools//tools/build_defs/repo:http.bzl", "http_archive")
load("@bazel_tools//tools/build_defs/repo:git.bzl", "git_repository")

#———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
# To get the latest ruby rules, grab the 'master' branch.

    branch = "master"
)

load("@rules_ruby//ruby:deps.bzl", "rules_ruby_dependencies")
rules_ruby_dependencies()

#———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
# Specify Ruby version — this will either build Ruby or use a local
# RBENV installation if the Ruby version matches.

#———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

load(
    "@rules_ruby//ruby:defs.bzl",
    "ruby_bundle",
)

ruby_bundle(
    name = "bundle",
    # Specify additional paths to be loaded from the gems at runtime, if any.
    # Since spec.require_paths in Gem specifications are auto-included, directory paths

)
----

=== `BUILD.bazel` file(s)

Any of the project `BUILD` files can now reference any gems included in the `Gemfile` referenced by the `ruby_bundle` rule, and defined in the project's `WORKSPACE` file.

==== Define Ruby Executable, Library and an RSpec

Add `ruby_library`, `ruby_binary`, `ruby_rspec` or `ruby_test` into your `BUILD.bazel` files.

[source,python]
----
#———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
# Define Ruby executable, test, spec and package a gem
#———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

load(
    "@rules_ruby//ruby:defs.bzl",
    "ruby_binary",
    "ruby_library",
    "ruby_test",
    "ruby_rspec",
)

ruby_library(
    name = "foo",
    srcs = glob(["lib/**/*.rb"]),
    includes = ["lib"],
    deps = [
      "@bundle//:activesupport",
      "@bundle//:awesome_print",
      "@bundle//:rubocop",
    ]
)

ruby_binary(
    name = "bar",
    srcs = ["bin/bar"],
    deps = [":foo"],
)

ruby_test(
    name = "foo-test",
    srcs = ["test/foo_test.rb"],
    deps = [":foo"],
)

ruby_rspec(
    name = "foo-spec",
    specs = glob(["spec/**/*.rb"]),
    rspec_args = { "--format": "progress" },
    deps = [":foo"]
}
----

==== Package Ruby files as a Gem

Use `ruby_gem` rule to package any number of ruby files or folders into a Ruby-Gem compatible ZIP archive.

[source,python]
----
load(
    "@rules_ruby//ruby:defs.bzl",
    "ruby_gem",
)

ruby_gem(
    name            = "awesome-sauce-gem", # name of the build target
    gem_name        = "awesome-sauce",     # name of the gem
    gem_version     = "0.1.0",
    gem_summary     = "Example gem to demonstrate Bazel Gem packaging",
    gem_description = "Example gem to demonstrate Bazel Gem packaging",
    gem_homepage    = "https://github.com/bazelruby/rules_ruby",
    gem_authors     = [
        "BazelRuby",
        "Konstantin Gredeskoul"
    ],
    gem_author_emails = [
        "bazelruby@googlegroups.com",
    ],
    gem_runtime_dependencies = {
        "colored2": "~> 3.1.2",
        "hashie": "",
    },
    gem_development_dependencies = {
        "rspec": "",
        "rspec-its": "",
        "rubocop": "",
    },
    srcs = [
        glob("{bin,exe,lib,spec}/**/*.rb")
    ],
    deps = [
        "//lib:example_gem",
    ],
)
----

=== Tool Specific Setup

==== ASDF

If you are using ASDF to manage your ruby installs, you can use them by adding `.bazelrc`:

----
build --test_env=ASDF_DIR --test_env=ASDF_DATA_DIR
build --action_env=ASDF_DIR --test_env=ASDF_DATA_DIR
----

You will have to be sure to export the `ASDF_DATA_DIR` in your profile since it's not set by default. e.g. `export ASDF_DATA_DIR="$HOME/.asdf"`

=== Rule Dependency Diagram

NOTE: this diagram is somewhat outdated.

The following diagram attempts to capture the implementation behind `ruby_library` that depends on the result of `bundle install`, and a `ruby_binary` that depends on both:

=== `ruby_bundle`

*NOTE: This is a repository rule, and can only be used in a `WORKSPACE` file.*

This rule installs gems defined in a Gemfile using Bundler, and exports individual gems from the bundle, as well as the entire bundle, available as a `ruby_library` that can be depended upon from other targets.

[source,python]
----
ruby_bundle(
    name,
    gemfile,
    gemfile_lock,
    bundler_version = "2.1.4",
    includes = {},
    excludes = {},
    srcs = [],
    vendor_cache = False,
    ruby_interpreter = "@ruby-system//:ruby",
)
----

[cols="15,85",options="header",]
|===
|Attributes |
|`name` a|
`Name, required`

A unique name for this rule.

|`gemfile` a|
`Label, required`

The `Gemfile` which Bundler runs with.

|`gemfile_lock` a|
`Label, optional`

The `Gemfile.lock` which Bundler runs with.

NOTE: This rule never updates the `Gemfile.lock`. It is your responsibility to generate/update `Gemfile.lock`

|`srcs` a|
`List of Labels, optional`

List of additional files required for Bundler to install gems. This could usually include `*.gemspec` files.

|`vendor_cache` a|
`Bool, optional`

Symlink the vendor directory into the Bazel build space, this allows Bundler to access vendored Gems

|`bundler_version` a|
`String, optional`

The Version of Bundler to use. Defaults to 2.1.4.

NOTE: This rule never updates the `Gemfile.lock`. It is your responsibility to generate/update `Gemfile.lock`

|`includes` a|
`Dictionary of key-value-pairs (key: string, value: list of strings), optional`

List of glob patterns per gem to be additionally loaded from the library. Keys are the names of the gems which require some file/directory paths not listed in the `require_paths` attribute of the gemspecs to be also added to `$LOAD_PATH` at runtime. Values are lists of blob path patterns, which are relative to the root directories of the gems.

|`excludes` a|
`Dictionary of key-value-pairs (key: string, value: list of strings), optional`

List of glob patterns per gem to be excluded from the library. Keys are the names of the gems. Values are lists of blob path patterns, which are relative to the root directories of the gems. The default value is `["**/* *.*", "**/* */*"]`

2+<|And other https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/be/common-definitions.html#common-attributes[common attributes].
|===


==== Conventions

`ruby_bundle` creates several targets that can be used downstream. In the examples below we assume that your `ruby_bundle` has a name `app_bundle`:

* `@app_bundle//:bundler` -- references just the Bundler from the bundle.
* `@app_bundle//:gems` -- references _all_ gems in the bundle (i.e. "the entire bundle").
* `@app_bundle//:gem-name` -- references _just the specified_ gem in the bundle, eg. `@app_bundle//:awesome_print`.
* `@app_bundle//:bin` -- references to all installed executables from this bundle, with individual executables accessible via eg. `@app_bundle//:bin/rubocop`

==== `WORKSPACE`:

[source,python]
----
load("@rules_ruby//ruby:defs.bzl", "ruby_bundle")

ruby_bundle(
    name = "gems",
    bundler_version = '2.1.4',
    gemfile = "//:Gemfile",
    gemfile_lock = "//:Gemfile.lock",
)
----

===== Vendor directory handling

To use the vendor cache, you have to declare a `managed_directory` in
your workspace. The name should match the name of the bundle.

[source,python]
----
load("@rules_ruby//ruby:defs.bzl", "ruby_bundle")

workspace(
    name = "my_wksp",
    managed_directories = {"@bundle": ["vendor"]},
)

ruby_bundle(
    name = "bundle",
    bundler_version = "2.1.2",
    vendor_cache = True,
    gemfile = "//:Gemfile",
    gemfile_lock = "//:Gemfile.lock",
)
----

==== `BUILD.bazel`:

[source,python]
----
# Reference the entire bundle with :gems

ruby_library(
    name = "foo",
    srcs = ["foo.rb"],
    deps = ["@gems//:gems"],
)

# Or, reference specific gems from the bundle like so:

ruby_binary(
    name = "rubocop",
    srcs = [":foo", ".rubocop.yml"],
    args = ["-P", "-D", "-c" ".rubocop.yml"],
    main = "@gems//:bin/rubocop",
    deps = ["@gems//:rubocop"],
)
----

=== `ruby_rspec`

[source,python]
----
ruby_rspec(
    name,
    deps,
    srcs,
    data,
    main,
    rspec_args,
    bundle,
    compatible_with,
    deprecation,
    distribs,
    features,
    licenses,
    restricted_to,
    tags,
    testonly,
    toolchains,
    visibility,
    args,
    size,
    timeout,
    flaky,
    local,
    shard_count
)
----
[cols="15,85",options="header",]
|===

== Potential Future Features

====
icon:check-square[fw] Using various versions of Ruby installed locally

icon:square[fw] Building native extensions in gems with Bazel

icon:square[fw] Releasing your gems with Bazel (https://github.com/coinbase/rules_ruby[Coinbase fork] might have this feature, worth checking)
====

== Contributing

We welcome contributions to RulesRuby. Please make yourself familiar with the xref:CODE_OF_CONDUCT.adoc[code of conduct], which basically says -- don't be an a-hole.

You may notice that there is more than one Bazel WORKSPACE inside this repo. There is one in `examples/simple_script` for instance, because
we use this example to validate and test the rules. So be mindful whether your current directory contains `WORKSPACE` file or not.

=== Setup

==== Using the Script

You will need Homebrew installed prior to running the script.

After that, cd into the top level folder and run the setup script in your Terminal:

[source,bash]
----
❯ bin/setup
----

This runs a complete setup, shouldn't take too long. You can explore various script options with the `help` command:

[source,bash]
----
❯ bin/setup -h

USAGE
  # without any arguments runs a complete setup.
  bin/setup

  # alternatively, a sub-setup function name can be passed:
  bin/setup [ gems | git-hook | help | main | os-specific | rbenv | remove-git-hook ]

DESCRIPTION:
  Runs full setup without any arguments.

  Accepts one optional argument — one of the actions that typically run
  as part of setup, with one exception — remove-git-hook.
  This action removes the git commit hook installed by the setup.

EXAMPLES:
    bin/setup

  Or, to run only one of the sub-functions (actions), pass
  it as an argument:

    bin/setup help
    bin/setup remove-git-hook
----

==== OS-Specific Setup

Note that the setup contains `os-specific` section. This is because there are two extension scripts:

* `bin/setup-linux`
* `bin/setup-darwin`

Those will install Bazel and everything else you need on either platform. In fact, we use the linux version on CI.

=== Verifying Your Environment

We provided a handy script `bin/show-env` to display where your dependencies are coming from. Here is an example of running it on a Mac OS-X system:

[source,bash]
----
❯ bin/show-env
----

image::docs/img/env.png[bin/show-env]

==== Issues During Setup

____
*Please report any errors to `bin/setup` as Issues on Github. You can assign them to @kigster.* If I am not responding fast enough, and you are in a hurry, please email kigster AT gmail directly.
____

=== Developing Rules

Besides making yourself familiar with the existing code, and https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/skylark/concepts.html[Bazel documentation on writing rules], you might want to follow this order:

. Setup dev tools as described in the <<Setup,setup>> section.
. hack, hack, hack...
. Make sure all tests pass -- you can run a single command for that (but see more on it <<test-script,below>>.

[source,bash]
----
bin/test-suite
----

OR, you can run individual Bazel test commands from the inside.

* `bazel test //...`
* `cd examples/simple_script && bazel test //...`

. Open a pull request in Github, and please be as verbose as possible in your description.

In general, it's always a good idea to ask questions first -- you can do so by creating an issue.

=== Running Tests

After running setup, and since this is a bazel repo you can use Bazel commands:

[source,python]
----
bazel build //...:all
bazel query //...:all
bazel test  //...:all
----

But to run tests inside each sub-WORKSPACE, you will need to repeat that in each sub-folder. Luckily, there is a better way.

==== Test Script

This script runs all tests (including sub-workspaces) when ran without arguments:

[source,bash]
----
bin/test-suite
----

Run it with `help` command to see other options, and to see what parts you can run individually. At the moment they are:

[source,bash]
----
# alternatively, a partial test name can be passed:
bin/test-suite [ all | bazel-info | buildifier | help | rspec | rubocop | simple-script |  workspace ]
----

On a MacBook Pro it takes about 3 minutes to run.

=== Linter

We are using RuboCop for ruby and Buildifier for Bazel. Both are represented by a single script `bin/linter`, which just like the scripts above runs ALL linters when ran without arguments, accepts `help` commnd, and can be run on a subset of linting strategies:

[source,bash]
----
bin/linter
----

The following are the partial linting functions you can run:

[source,bash]
----
# alternatively, a partial linter name can be passed:
bin/linter [ all | buildifier | help | rubocop ]

=== Regenerating README.pdf & Changelog

To regenerate, first you may need to grab an https://github.com/settings/tokens[API token] and export the `GITHUB_TOKEN` variable:

[source,bash]
----
export GITHUB_TOKEN=....
----

Then use the `make` target:

[source,bash]
----
make update
----

Or, manually:

[source,bash]
----
gem install github_changelog_generator
github_changelog_generator -u bazelruby -p rules_ruby -t your-github-token
----
