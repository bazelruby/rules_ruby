# How to Contribute

This repository is currently a WIP, forked from
[rules_ruby](https://github.com/bazelruby/rules_ruby) for use in building and
testing Ruby [Protobuf](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf).

We'd love to accept your patches and contributions to this project. There are
just a few small guidelines you need to follow.
